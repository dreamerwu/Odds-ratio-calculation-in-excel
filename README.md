1) odds ratio (OR) calculation:

The odds ratio tells us the ratio of the odds of an event occuring in a treatment group to the odds of an event occuring in a control group.
For example:

                     non-durable_responders       durable_responders
NOTCH1_mutation               5                           4
NOTCH1_wildtype               7                           38

so the odds ratio of NOTCH1 mutation in non-durable_responders vs durable_responders is: (5/7)/(4/38) = 6.7857
