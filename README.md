1) odds ratio (OR) calculation:

The odds ratio tells us the ratio of the odds of an event occuring in a treatment group to the odds of an event occuring in a control group.
For example:

                     non-durable_responders       durable_responders            total
NOTCH1_mutation               5                           4                       9
NOTCH1_wildtype               7                           38                      45
total                         12                          42                      54

so the odds ratio of NOTCH1 mutation in non-durable_responders vs durable_responders is: OR = (5/7)/(4/38) = 6.7857

2) The standard error of the log odds ratio being:
SE{ln(OR)}= SQRT(1/5 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/38) = 0.786875


2) 95% confidential interval (CI) calculation:

95% CI for odds ratio = exp(ln(OR)-1.96*SE(ln(OR))) to exp(ln(OR)+1.96*SE(ln(OR)))
where SE(ln(OR)) = SQRT (ABS (1/5 + 1/7 + 1/4 + 1/38) )


3) one-tailed/two-tailed p-value calculation:

one-tailed p-value = HYPGEOM.DIST(5,12,9,54,TRUE)
two-tailed p-value = HYPGEOM.DIST (5,12,9,54,TRUE)+1 - HYPGEOM.DIST(7,12,9,54,TRUE)
